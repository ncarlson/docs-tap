## <a id='1-3-0'></a> v1.3.0

**Release Date**: MONTH DAY, 2022

### <a id='1-3-new-features'></a> New features

This release includes the following changes, listed by component and area.

#### <a id="app-acc-features"></a> Application Accelerator

- Feature 1
- Feature 2

#### <a id="alv-features"></a>Application Live View

- Feature 1
- Feature 2

#### <a id="app-sso-features"></a>Application Single Sign-On

- AppSSO uses a custom Security Context Constraint to provide OpenShift support.
- Kubernetes 1.24 is supported.
- Comply with the restricted _Pod Security Standard_ and give least privileges to the controller.
- `AuthServer` gets TLS-enabled `Ingress` autoconfigured. This can be controlled via `AuthServer.spec.tls`.
- Custom CAs are supported.
- More and better audit logs for authorization server events; `TOKEN_REQUEST_REJECTED`
- Enable the `/userinfo` endpoint.
- Increase the controller's default memory request and limits.
- Rename all Kubernetes resources in the _AppSSO_ package from _operator_ to _appsso-controller_.
- The controller restarts when its configuration is updated.
- The controller configuration is kept in a `Secret`.
- All existing `AuthServer` are updated and roll out when the controller's configuration changes significantly.

##### Deprecations

- `AuthServer.spec.issuerURI` is deprecated and marked for removal in the next release. Please, migrate
  to `AuthServer.spec.tls`.

- [Supply Chain Security Tools - Sign](scst-sign/overview.md) is deprecated. For migration information, see [Migration From Supply Chain Security Tools - Sign](./scst-policy/migration.hbs.md).

- The (legacy) CNB BOM format is deprecated, but enabled by default in TBS. In TAP 1.4, support will be disabled by 
default. And in TAP 1.5, support will be removed. To manually disabled legacy CNB BOM support add 
`include_legacy_bom=false` to the `tbs-values.yml` file or to the `tap-values.yml` file under the `buildservice:`
stanza.

##### Bug fixes

- Emit the audit `TOKEN_REQUEST_REJECTED` event when the `refresh_token` grant fails.
- The service binding `Secret` is updated when a `ClientRegistration` changes significantly.


#### <a id="default-roles-features"></a>Default roles for Tanzu Application Platform

- Added new default role `service-operator`. 

### Breaking changes

- `AuthServer.spec.identityProviders.internalUser.users.password` is now provided as plain text instead of _bcrypt_
  -hashed.
- When an authorization server fails to obtain a token from an OpenID identity provider, it will record
  an `INVALID_IDENTITY_PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION` audit event instead of `INVALID_UPSTREAM_PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION`.
- Package configuration `webhooks_disabled` has been removed and `extra` is renamed to `internal`.
- The `KEYS COUNT` print column has been replaced with the more insightful `STATUS` for `AuthServer`.
- The `sub` claim in `id_token`s and `access_token`s now follow the `<providerId>_<userId>` pattern,
  instead of `<providerId>/<userId>`. The previous pattern could cause bugs if used in URLs without
  proper URL-encoding in client applications. If your client application has stored `sub` claims,
  you may have to update them to match the new pattern.

##### Migration guide `v1.0.0` â†’ `v2.0.0`

We strongly recommended that you recreate your `AuthServers` after upgrading your AppSSO package installation to `2.0.0`
with the following changes:

- Migrate from `.spec.issuerURI` to `.spec.tls`. AppSSO will template your issuer URI for you and provide TLS-enabled. A
  custom `Service` and ingress resource are no longer required.
  1. Configure one of `.spec.tls.{issuerRef, certificateRef, secretRef}`(
     see [Issuer URI & TLS](app-sso/service-operators/issuer-uri-and-tls.md)). Optionally, disable TLS
     with `.spec.tls.disabled`.
  2. Remove `.spec.issuerURI`.
  3. Delete your `AuthServer`-specific `Service` and ingress resources.
  4. Apply your `AuthServer`. You will find its issuer URI in `.status.issuerURI`.
  5. You can now update the redirect URIs in your upstream identity providers.

- If you are using the `internalUnsafe` identity provider migrate existing users by replacing the bcrypt hash by the
  plain-text equivalent. You can still use existing
  bcrypt passwords by prefixing them with `{bcrypt}`:

  ```yaml
  ---
  apiVersion: sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
  kind: AuthServer
  metadata:
    # ...
  spec:
    identityProviders:
      - name: internal
        internalUnsafe:
          users:
            # v1.0
            - username: test-user-1
              password: $2a$10$201z9o/tHlocFsHFTo0plukh03ApBYe4dRiXcqeyRQH6CNNtS8jWK # bcrypt-encoded "password"
              # ...
            # v2.0
            - username: "test-user-1"
              password: "{bcrypt}$2a$10$201z9o/tHlocFsHFTo0plukh03ApBYe4dRiXcqeyRQH6CNNtS8jWK" # same bcrypt hash, with {bcrypt} prefix
            - username: "test-user-2"
              password: "password" # plain text
    # ...
  ```

New versions of AppSSO are available from the Tanzu Application Platform package repository. See [AppSSO documentation](app-sso/platform-operators/upgrades.md) for detailed upgrade steps. 
You can also upgrade AppSSO as part of upgrading Tanzu Application Platform as a whole. See [Upgrading Tanzu Application Platform](upgrading.hbs.md) for more information.

**Scanning Java source code that uses Gradle package manager may not reveal vulnerabilities:**
- For most languages, Source Code Scanning only scans files present in the source code repository.
Except for support added for Java projects using Maven, no network calls are made to fetch dependencies.
For languages using dependency lock files, such as Golang and Node.js,
Grype uses the lock files to check the dependencies for vulnerabilities.

- For Java using Gradle, dependency lock files are not guaranteed, so Grype uses
the dependencies present in the built binaries (`.jar` or `.war` files) instead.

- Because VMware does not encourage committing binaries to source code repositories,
Grype fails to find vulnerabilities during a Source Scan.
The vulnerabilities are still found during the Image Scan
after the binaries are built and packaged as images.

- Known issue 2

#### <a id="vscode-ext-known-issues"></a>VS Code Extension

- **Unable to view workloads on the panel when connected to GKE cluster:** 
When connecting to Google's GKE clusters, an error might appear with the text `WARNING: the gcp auth plugin is deprecated in v1.22+, unavailable in v1.25+; use gcloud instead.` the cause is that GKE authentication was extracted into a separate plugin and is no longer inside kubernetes client or libraries. To fix this follow the instructions to [download and configure the GKE authentication plugin](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke) 

- **Warning Notification when cancelling action:**
When executing `Tanzu: Debug Start`, `Tanzu: Live Update Start`, or `Tanzu: Apply` the user is presented with a quick pick list when there are multiple options. If the user cancels, by either the `ESC` key or clicking outside the list, the user will be presented with a warning notification indicating that no workloads or tiltfiles could be found. This message can be ignored.
